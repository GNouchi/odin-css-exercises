## How To Use These Exercises

1. Fork and clone Original [repo](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/css-exercises) . Dunno how?-> [fork a repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).
    If you need help cloning to your local environment, you can learn how from the GitHub documentation on [cloning a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github/cloning-a-repository).
1. Go to an exercise directory and open the HTML file in a web browser. 
1. For each exercise, read the README thoroughly before starting any work.
    - Each README has a "Self Check" list. Use this.
1. Make your edits in the `index.html` and/or the `style.css` files in order to make the output in your browser look like the Desired Outcome image(s).
    - Depending on the instructions of the exercise, you may only need to make edits in one of these files.
1. Once you successfully finish an exercise, check TOP's solution to compare it with yours.
    - If your solution differs wildly from TOP's solution (and still passes the exercise's requirements), that's completely fine. 


## Some Hints
- The official solutions put all changes at the _end_ of the CSS file, which may duplicate some selectors This is just to show your before and after.
(e.g. there might be a `body {}` in the given CSS and another `body {}` in the solution). 
- These exercises are intended to test your knowledge of CSS, not your ability to guess. Unless listed in the self-check section, do not worry about getting the exact pixel value for things like margin, padding and font size. 
- You may need to add some elements to your HTML to get things into the right spot. 
- You may need to add more selectors to your CSS file.
